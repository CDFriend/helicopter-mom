A 3rd generation AI Snake built for competition @ BattleSnake 2018

Following the equal success and failure of Terrible Dad (BattleSnake 2016) and Problem Child (BattleSnake 2017) comes a completely rebuilt snake for BattleSnake 2018: **Helicopter Mom**. This time though, this snake is coming back with a vengeance.

Details coming soon on snake's structure, and methodology.
